Get-CleanData_Project
=====================

This repository contain the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data


## The script

The repository contains the script **Run_analysis.R** that will produce a tidy data set from the raw data as required by the assignement.
In order to run properly, the script has to be located in the same directory as the **Dataset** folder containing all raw data.

Run the script in R using: *source("Run_analysis.R")*


## Codebook

#### Raw data
Raw data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
