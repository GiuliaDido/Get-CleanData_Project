Get-CleanData_Project
=====================

This repository contains the course project for *Getting and Cleaning Data*.


## Script

This repository contains the script **Run_analysis.R** that will produce a tidy data set from the raw data as required by the assignement.
In order to run properly, the script has to be located in the same directory as the **Dataset** folder containing all raw data.
It also needs the **dplyr** package to be installed and loaded.

Run the script in R using:    *source("Run_analysis.R")*


## Codebook

The **Codebook.md** file contains a description of the *raw dataset* and of the *tidy dataset* as well as all the steps performed in the data-cleaning analysis.
